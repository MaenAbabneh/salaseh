# Salaseh Seating Map System ðŸŽ­

## Overview

A complete seating map system for the Jordanian comedy troupe Al-Salaseh. This system allows users to view interactive seating maps, select seats, and book tickets for comedy shows.

## Features Implemented

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation

#### 1. Event Model (`database/event.model.ts`)

- **ISeat Interface**: Represents individual seats with:
  - `id`: Unique seat identifier
  - `row`: Row name (A, B, C, etc.)
  - `number`: Seat number within the row
  - `status`: 'available', 'booked', or 'locked'
  - `priceTier`: VIP, Premium, Standard, or Economy

- **ISeatingMap Interface**: Complete seating layout with:
  - `stage`: Stage description
  - `rows`: Object mapping row names to seat arrays

- **IEvent Interface**: Event details including optional seatingMap

#### 2. Server Actions (`lib/action/event.action.ts`)

- **saveSeatingMap()**: Updates event seating map using MongoDB $set
- **getEventById()**: Fetches event with performance optimization (.lean())
- **createEvent()**: Helper function for creating new events
- All functions use proper error handling with handleError and action utilities

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

#### 3. Event Details Page (`app/events/[id]/page.tsx`)

- Server Component that fetches event data
- Handles missing events with notFound()
- Displays event information and seating map
- Type-safe with proper IEvent interface usage

#### 4. Interactive SeatMap Component (`components/events/index.tsx`)

- **Client Component** with "use client" directive
- **State Management**: Uses useState for selectedSeats array
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Click to select/deselect available seats
  - Visual feedback for different seat statuses
  - Hover effects and tooltips
- **Dynamic Styling**:
  - Green: Available seats
  - Blue: Selected seats
  - Red: Booked seats (disabled)
  - Yellow: Locked seats (disabled)
- **Booking Summary**:
  - Lists selected seats with details
  - Calculates total price
  - Confirm booking button
